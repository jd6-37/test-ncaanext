This texture replaces RUBBER PAD elbow equipment. You can replace it with anything for the upper arm, most commonly, a team color short sleeve undershirt.

The file should be named exactly:

NOTE: As of V14, there is a mod-default replacement texture for Rubber Pad. For your custom texture to work, you must remove or rename that texture of this same name located in replacements > general > gear. As with all replacement textures, make sure there is only one file with that name in the entire replacements folder. 

This is a global shared texture. You can replace this with anything you like, but keep in mind that it will appear on any player on any team that has RUBBER PAD elbow equipment. However, no players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is "safe" to use in dynasties for your team-color gear.
