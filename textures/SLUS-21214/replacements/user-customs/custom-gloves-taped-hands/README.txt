This texture replaces the TAPED HANDS hand equipment and can be used for custom gloves.

The file should be named exactly:

This is a global shared texture. You can make these gloves any color or design you like, but keep in mind that they will appear on any player on any team that has TAPED HANDS hand equipment. However, no players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is "safe" to use in dynasties for your team-color gloves.
