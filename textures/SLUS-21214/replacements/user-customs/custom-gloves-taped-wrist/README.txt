These replace the TAPED WRIST wrist equipment and can be used for custom gloves. 

There are two filenames for this texture. You need two copies of your glove texture, same PNG file, but with these two names exactly:

NOTE: These cannot be used with half sleeves or any other wrist equipment. The game will always automatically use Wt Wrist plus this custom glove texture. Therefore, it is recommended you first utilize the TAPED HANDS replacement, and then use this replacement method if you need an additional custom glove and you're okay with everyone who wears this glove having white wristbands.

This is a global shared texture. You can make these gloves any color or design you like, but keep in mind that they will appear on any player on any team that has TAPED WRIST equipment. However, no players in the default mod roster have this equipment, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is "safe" to use in dynasties for your team-color gloves.
