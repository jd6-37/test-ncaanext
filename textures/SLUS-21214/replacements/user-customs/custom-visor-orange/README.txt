This texture replaces the ORANGE VISOR equipment and can be used for a custom visor.

The file should be named exactly:

This is a global shared texture. You can make this visor any color or design you like, but keep in mind that it will appear on any player on any team that has ORANGE VISOR equipment. However, no players in the default mod roster have this visor, and the CPU will never give incoming recruits this or assign it to CPU teams in your dynasty, so it is "safe" to use in dynasties for your team-color gloves.
